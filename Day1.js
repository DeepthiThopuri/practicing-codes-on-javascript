//variable and Data types
/*A variable is like a labelled box where you can store data. 
Imagine you have a box labelled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. 
 In JavaScript, you would do this by writing var age = 25; (one of the ways, we'll learn about rest soon). T
    his means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.*/
    var age = 25;
console.log(age);
const str="deepthi"
console.log(str);
let val=2.4
console.log(val);
